<h1>Really Honest Book Reviews</h1>
<p>I read a lot of books about many different subjects. Though I'm not a
book critic, and I don't do this for a living, I enjoy a really good read
every now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Rainbow Returns</em>by E. Smith</li>
<li><em>Seven Steps to Immeasurable Wealth</em>by R. U. Needy</li>
<li><em>The Food-Lovers Guide to Weight Loss</em>by L. Goode</li>
<li><em>The Silly Person"s Guide to Seriousness</em>by M. Nott</li>
</ul>
